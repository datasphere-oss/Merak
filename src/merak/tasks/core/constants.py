"""
The tasks in this module can be used to represent constant values.

In general, users will not instantiate these tasks by hand; they will be automatically created
whenever the merak engine detects that a constant value is required. In many cases, merak
will not add `Constant` tasks to the graph; optimizing them as flow-level attributes instead.
